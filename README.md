# Foo Food Fighters
A web application for real-time dietary classification. For my 2023-2024 Google research group. [More Information Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RKkR4Gn1ErfyojjL3SQZ0STdPTwmteu1WJ1i8Gyh3UE/edit?usp=sharing)

## About 
I've always struggled with tracking my calories. Figuring out the exact content of what's on my plate, measuring my food down to the gram, and making sure I am staying below my set amount of calories for my goal. So I pitched the idea of making macro-tracking as easy as possible: just one picture of your food and you'll be tracking your nutrients. We did this using a special type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), namely [MobileNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861), with the special advantage of being so lightweight and performant that you can run it locally on your mobile devices.
